The **N+1 problem** hampers application performance, manifesting when an app issues numerous requests downstream in response to a single upstream request. To grasp this, consider the following example:

## Example Scenario

Imagine we're enhancing a feature that involves fetching data from the [JSON Placeholder API], requiring posts and their authors' details.

### Fetching Posts

Initially, we request all posts:

```bash
curl https::/jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
[
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Creating Solutions for Challenges",
    "body": "We anticipate and understand challenges, creating solutions while considering exceptions and criticisms."
  },
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Understanding Identity",
    "body": "Life's essence, measured through time, presents pains and joys. We find solace in the mundane, seeking meaning beyond the visible."
  }
]
```

This command retrieves posts from the API, with each post containing a `userId` field denoting its author.

### Fetching Authors

Subsequently, we fetch details for each post's author, exemplified by:

```bash
curl https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Leanne Graham",
  "username": "Bret",
  "email": "Sincere@april.biz",
  "address": {
    "street": "Kulas Light",
    "suite": "Apt. 556",
    "city": "Gwenborough",
    "zipcode": "92998-3874",
    "geo": {
      "lat": "-37.3159",
      "lng": "81.1496"
    }
  },
  "phone": "1-770-736-8031 x56442",
  "website": "hildegard.org",
  "company": {
    "name": "Romaguera-Crona",
    "catchPhrase": "Multi-layered client-server neural-net",
    "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
  }
}
```

For 100 posts, this leads to 100 additional requests to obtain author details, totaling 101 requests.

The N+1 issue with the JSON Placeholder API arises when fetching 100 posts prompts 100 separate requests for author details, cumulating to 101 requests.

This issue escalates in real-life scenarios with thousands of posts and users, multiplying the server requests, which strains resources, hikes server costs, slows response times, and can even cause server downtime. Addressing the N+1 issue during application design and development is crucial for efficient API usage. We will examine solutions to mitigate this problem.

## Initial Configuration with TailCall CLI

Before diving into solutions, it's insightful to see the N+1 problem in action using the TailCall CLI with the initial `.graphql` configuration:

```plaintext
‚ùØ tailcall start ./examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql
  INFO File read: ./examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql ... ok
  INFO N + 1 detected: 1
  INFO üöÄ Tailcall launched at [0.0.0.0:8000] over HTTP/1.1
  INFO üåç Playground: https://tailcall.run/playground/?u=http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql
  INFO GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts HTTP/1.1
  INFO GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/8 HTTP/1.1
  ...
  INFO GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/10 HTTP/1.1
```

These logs demonstrate the sequence of requests made to fetch posts and then individual users, highlighting the N+1 problem in real-time.

## Optimizing with Batching

It's an effective technique to group similar requests into one, greatly reducing the number of server calls. The TailCall CLI provides this capability to address the typical N+1 issue that arises in GraphQL.
To tap into this feature, edit the `@http` directive on `Post.user` in your GraphQL schema as follows:
```graphql showLineNumbers
type Post {
  id: Int!
  userId: Int!
  title: String!
  body: String!
  user: User
    @http(
      path: "/users"
      # highlight-start
      query: [{key: "id", value: "{{value.userId}}"}]
      batchKey: ["id"]
      # highlight-end
    )
}
```
The described changes introduce two significant tweaks to the `@http` directive and incorporate the `batchKey` configuration:
1. `query: [{key: "id", value: "{{value.userId}}"}]`: In this configuration, the TailCall CLI generates a URL that aligns the user id with the `userId` from the parent `Post`. For a batch of posts, the CLI compiles a single URL, such as `/users?id=1&id=2&id=3...id=10`, consolidating the requests into one.

2. `batchKey: ["id"]`: This parameter instructs the system to convert the list of responses into a map internally, using the user's `id` as the unique key. In essence, it allows the system to differentiate each user value in the response list.

By using this approach, you can reduce the number of requests from 101 (for 100 posts plus one initial request for the post list) down to 2. This significant optimization effectively handles the N+1 problem, thereby enhancing your application's efficiency and user experience.

After incorporating the `batchKey` optimization, let's observe the transformed behavior through the TailCall CLI:

```plaintext
‚ùØ tailcall start ./examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql
  INFO File read: ./examples/jsonplaceholder.graphql ... ok
  INFO N + 1 detected: 0
  INFO üöÄ Tailcall launched at [0.0.0.0:8000] over HTTP/1.1
  INFO üåç Playground: https://tailcall.run/playground/?u=http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql
  INFO GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts HTTP/1.1
  INFO GET http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?id=1&id=10&id=2&id=3&id=4&id=5&id=6&id=7&id=8&id=9 HTTP/1.1
```

### The Impact of Optimization

The logs now reveal a substantial reduction in requests. Initially, fetching 100 posts would lead to an additional 100 requests to gather author details, totaling 101 requests. However, after applying batching with the `batchKey`, we observe two requests:

1. A single request to fetch all posts.
2. A single consolidated request for all users involved in the posts, using query parameters to fetch multiple users in one go.

This optimization starkly contrasts the initial approach by reducing the number of server requests, thus minimizing server load, enhancing response times, and potentially lowering server costs. It demonstrates the effectiveness of addressing the N+1 problem through thoughtful schema design and the use of advanced tooling like the TailCall CLI, which facilitates a more efficient data fetching strategy that's crucial for scalable and performant web applications.
